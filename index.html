			<h2>What is fbapi4j?</h2>
		    <p>
		    	The FogBugz API for Java is an open source library that allows Java developers to easily write applications that interact
		    	with the <a href="http://support.fogcreek.com/help/topics/advanced/API.html">FogBugz XML API</a>.  Its primary purpose is to allow Java developers to programmatically file bugs with <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/">FogBugz</a>
		    	when their software crashes.
		    </p>
		    
		    <h2>How Do I Use fbapi4j?</h2>
		    <p>
		    	Please refer to the <a href="quick-start.html">quick start guide</a>.
		    </p>
		    
		    <h2>Does fbapi4j Use BugzScout?</h2>
		    <p>
		    	No. fbapi4j connects to FogBugz via the <a href="http://support.fogcreek.com/help/topics/advanced/API.html">FogBugz XML API</a>. 
		    	<a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ/docs/40/Articles/BugzScout.html">BugzScout</a> was the original API for programmatically submitting cases to FogBugz.  Although BugzScout still works (at the time of writing),
		    	it has largely been made obsolete by the XML API, which is more powerful.  (For example, the XML API allows you to attach files to cases, which BugzScout did not.)
		    </p>

			<h2>Who Develops and Maintains This?</h2>
			<p>
				fbapi4j was developed by <a href="http://github.com/nathanbowser">Nathan Bowser</a>, <a href="http://github.com/joegallo">Joe Gallo</a>, and <a href="http://www.michaelrighi.com">Michael Righi</a> with
